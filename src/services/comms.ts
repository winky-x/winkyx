 * @fileoverview Communications Service for WinkyX.

 * communication (BLE, Wi-Fi Direct). It provides the API that the application
 * will use to interact with the communication hardware, allowing the core logic
 * to be developed independently of the native implementation.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - Peer: Type definition for a discovered peer.
 * - startDiscovery: Simulates starting a scan for nearby peers.
 * - sendMessageToPeer: Simulates sending a message to a specific peer.
